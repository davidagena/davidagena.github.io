##What is Typescript?
Typescript is an open-source programming language created by Microsoft. Since Typescript is also a superset of Javascript, any valid form of Javascript also works for Typescript. 

##Experience with Typescript:
Overall I felt the similarities between Typescript and Javascript so it wasn't too hard getting used to Typescript. Though there were some differences between the two, it didn't take long for me to understand some of the differences and adapt to them. It was kind of enjoyable learning a new language that is closely related to another one so the learning curve wasn't too bad. I would recommend learning Typescript if you have the time, however it would help to have learned Javascript beforehand to make the experience better.

##WODs:
WODs or "Workouts of the Day", have been one of the more helpful exercises for developing my coding skills. Personally, I feel that doing the work rather than seeing it be done is the best way for me to learn so WODs have been great at helping me do so. In addition to this, the videos at the end that show the process help with roadblocks and solidifying my knowledge on the topic being covered via WOD. Overall, I enjoy the short practice we get in the form of WODs and look forward to doing more.

##AI Reflection:
I used ChatGPT to help with organizing my ideas but other than that the ideas, reflections, and writing were done on my own.
