What is Typescript?
Typescript is an open-source programming language created by Microsoft. Since Typescript is also a superset of Javascript, any valid form of Javascript also works for Typescript. 

Experience with Typescript:
Overall I felt the similarities between Typescript and Javascript so it wasn't too hard getting used to Typescript. Though there were some differences between the two, it didn't take long for me to understand some of the differences and adapt to them. It was kind of enjoyable learning a new language that is closely related to another one so the learning curve wasn't too bad. I would recommend learning Typescript if you have the time, however it would help to have learned Javascript beforehand to make the experience better.
