##Importance of Coding Standards
There are various methods to improve your coding skills but, personally implementing coding standards is one of if not the best methods for improving one's coding. Coding standards refer to a set of "rules" and guidelines that people follow when writing code. Though some people think that it's trivial, I believe that it's a great way to make sure your code is solid with little to no errors included in it. Implementing this method is a very reliable way to avoid common mistakes and is a reliable way to continue improving upon your coding skills. 

##First Impressions on ESLint
At first downloading and using ESLint was difficult since I had to download various extensions to VS Code. In addition, I had to download a new terminal extension "fish" which wasn't mentioned and required the use of ChatGPT along with the internet to figure out. However, after getting through all the beginning issues using ESLint was very easy. Having it identify errors in the code was useful, and it provided suggestions to fix the code which was very helpful in improving my code. Overall I never had any notable grievances with ESLint and found that most times it was useful when coding for assignments. The only issue I had was in the beginning with downloading all the dependencies.
