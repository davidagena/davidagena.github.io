StudyForYou is an interactive website created for the sole purpose of helping students at any level with their classes. By, uploading lectures and notes into the website, it creates study material. The individual is then able to study the material to their heart's content.

For this project, I was the lead programmer who was responsible for programming the various capabilities of the website. Along with a small group of people, we were able to create a website similar to a data bank which is also capable of creating study material based off the information given. Due to the complexity of this, we divided into different teams to solve the different aspects of it. 

Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
