Tigers and Goats is a game coded in Python that uses a "matrix" to function. In this game, you play against the computer as either the Tigers or Goats. The objective of the Tigers is to eat the Goats by traveling along the board, the Tiger "eats" the Goat by jumping over them and landing onto an open square. The Goats however want to trap the Tigers so that they have no more open squares to move to. During this project, the goal was to constantly update and improve the AI side of the game to make it smarter. 

For this project, I playtested and helped run code in Python to make suggestions on what can be done to improve the decision-making of the AI in different situations. In addition to this I was tasked with finding potential loopholes in the AI's playstyle along with ways to beat it. When a tactic is found or loophole, then I can relay this information to the team and we could figure out a way to work around it.
